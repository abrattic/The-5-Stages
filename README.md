# The 5 Stages
This is a project I created to learn Java and understand its 

Here are the rules as presented in-game:

## Rules:
- You will face five stages of enemies.
- The number of enemies you face on each battlefield will correspond to the battlefield numbering.

- You will start out with 100 health.
- For every turn you will deal some damage and take some as well.

- The type of enemies on each stage will be decided randomly.

- On each turn, you might heal yourself (or you might not).

This is basically a very basic implementation of a very basic fight mechanic of an imaginary turn-based RPG.

## Problems
The health system isn't very good. I'll need to do much more research on their designs for it to be any good.
